BootStrap Contact form with PHP

This is a fully working bootstrap contact form which includes font-awesome icons in the form itself & Google's Captcha API to help prevent spam.

The whole form is fully responsive so it will look great and usable across any device.  I have not included any personal styles with this package only the required ones (Bootstrap's & Font Awesome's).  

There is however a link in the header of the index file to a stylesheet named main.css.  

I have included the PHP form the form to function at the top of the index file, this however can be moved to another file if your wish to do so.  The only reason i added it to the index file is for ease of uploading.  

If you have any changes to the form please feel free to make them.  Also feel free to use the form as you please, just remeber to leave some recognition. 

Have fun
